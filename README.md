## How It Works

The game utilizes the [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/random) to fetch a random quote. Users can then type the displayed quote in an input field, and the application will highlight correct and incorrect characters in real-time. The timer measures the time taken to complete the typing test. Upon successfully completing the quote, a new quote is fetched, and the process repeats.
